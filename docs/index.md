  required.
* **Expressive**: create apps with a powerful, popular and easy to learn
  language like Python.
* **Scalable**: no need for expensive infrastructure ~ your code runs in
  your user's browser.

* **Universal**: your code runs anywhere a browser runs... which is
  _everywhere_!
* **Secure**: PyScript runs in the world's most battle-tested secure platform,
  the browser!
