# Beginning PyScript

PyScript is a platform for running
<a href="https://python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>
in modern web browsers.

Create apps with a
<a href="https://pyscript.com/" target="_blank">PyScript development environment</a>:
write code, curate the project's assets, and test your application.

To distribute a PyScript application, host it on the web, then click
on the link to your application. PyScript and the browser do the rest.

This page covers these core aspects of PyScript in a beginner friendly manner.
We only assume you know how to use a browser and edit text.

!!! note

    The easiest way to get a PyScript development environment and hosting, is
    to use [pyscript.com](https://pyscript.com) in your browser.

    It is a free service that helps you create new projects from templates, and
    then edit, preview and deploy your apps with a unique link.

    While the core features of [pyscript.com](https://pyscript.com) will always be
    free, additional paid-for capabilities directly support and sustain the
    PyScript open source project. Commercial and educational support is also
    available.

## An application

All PyScript applications need three things:

1. An `index.html` file that is served to your browser.
2. A description of the Python environment in which your application will run.
   This is usually specified by a `pyscript.json` or `pyscript.toml` file.
3. Python code (usually in a file called something like `main.py`) that defines
   how your application works.

Create these files with your favourite code editor on your local file system.
Alternatively, [pyscript.com](https://pyscript.com) will take away all the pain
of organising, previewing and deploying your application.

If you're using your local file system, you'll need a way to view your
application in your browser. If you already have Python installed on
your local machine, serve your files with the following command run from your
terminal and in the same directory as your files:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

Point your browser at [http://localhost:8000](localhost:8000). Remember to
refresh the page (`CTRL-R`) to see any updates you may have made.

!!! note
    If you're using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor,
    the
    [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
    can be used to reload the page as you edit your files.

    Alternatively, if you have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) you
    could use VSCode in your browser as a
    [PyScript aware "CodeSpace"](https://github.com/ntoll/codespaces-project-template-pyscript/)
    (just follow the instructions in the README file).

If you decide to use [pyscript.com](https://pyscript.com) (recommended for
first steps), once signed in, create a new project by pressing the "+" button
on the left hand side below the site's logo. You'll be presented with a page
containing three columns (listing your files, showing your code and previewing
the app). The "save" and "run" buttons do exactly what you'd expect.

Let's build a simple PyScript application that translates English üá¨üáß into
Pirate üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è  speak. In order to do this we'll make use of the
[arrr](https://arrr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. By building this app
you'll be introduced to all the core concepts of PyScript at an introductory
level.

You can see this application embedded into the page below (try it out!):

<iframe src="https://ntoll.pyscriptapps.com/piratical/v5/" style="border: 1px solid black; width:100%;min-height: 400px; border-radius: 0.2rem; box-shadow: var(--md-shadow-z1);"></iframe>

Let's explore each of the three files that make this app work.

### pyscript.json

This file tells PyScript and your browser about various
[configurable aspects](../user-guide/configuration)
of your application. Put simply, it tells PyScript what it needs in order to run
your application. The only thing we need to show is that we require the third
party `arrr` module to do the
[actual translation](https://arrr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

We do this by putting `arrr` as the single entry in a list of required
`packages`, so the content of `pyscript.json` looks like this:

``` json title="pyscript.json"
{
    "packages": ["arrr"]
}
```

### index.html

Next we come to the `index.html` file that is first served to your browser.

To start out, we need to tell the browser that this HTML document uses
PyScript, and so we create a `<script>` tag that references the PyScript
module in the document's `<head>` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
      <title>ü¶ú Polyglot - Piratical PyScript</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/releases/2025.10.3/core.css">
      <script type="module" src="https://pyscript.net/releases/2025.10.3/core.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <!-- TODO: Fill in our custom application code here... -->

  </body>
</html>
```

Notice that the `<body>` of the document is empty except for the TODO comment.
It's in here that we put standard HTML content to define our user interface, so
the `<body>` now looks like:

``` html
<body>
  <h1>Polyglot ü¶ú üí¨ üá¨üáß ‚û°Ô∏è üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</h1>
  <p>Translate English into Pirate speak...</p>
  <input type="text" name="english" id="english" placeholder="Type English here..." />
  <button py-click="translate_english">Translate</button>
  <div id="output"></div>
  <script type="py" src="./main.py" config="./pyscript.json"></script>
</body>
```

This fragment of HTML contains the application's header (`<h1>`), some
instructions between the `<p>` tags, an `<input>` box for the English text, and
a `<button>` to click to generate the translation. Towards the end there's a
`<div id="output">` which will contain the resulting pirate speak as the
application's output.

There's something strange about the `<button>` tag: it has a `py-click`
attribute with the value `translate_english`. This is, in fact, the name of a
Python function we'll run whenever the button is clicked. Such `py-*` style
attributes are [built into PyScript](api.md#html-attributes).

We put all this together in the `script` tag at the end of the `<body>`. This
tells the browser we're using PyScript (`type="py"`), and where PyScript
should find the Python source code (`src="./main.py"`). Finally, we indicate
where PyScript should find the configuration (`config="./pyscript.json"`).

In the end, our HTML should look like this:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
      <title>ü¶ú Polyglot - Piratical PyScript</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/releases/2025.10.3/core.css">
      <script type="module" src="https://pyscript.net/releases/2025.10.3/core.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Polyglot ü¶ú üí¨ üá¨üáß ‚û°Ô∏è üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</h1>
    <p>Translate English into Pirate speak...</p>
    <input type="text" id="english" placeholder="Type English here..." />
    <button py-click="translate_english">Translate</button>
    <div id="output"></div>
    <script type="py" src="./main.py" config="./pyscript.json"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

But this only defines _how_ the user interface should look. To define its
behaviour we need to write some Python. Specifically, we need to define the
`translate_english` function, used when the button is clicked.

### main.py

The behaviour of the application is defined in `main.py`. It looks like this:

``` python linenums="1" title="main.py"
import arrr
from pyscript import document


def translate_english(event):
    input_text = document.querySelector("#english")
    english = input_text.value
    output_div = document.querySelector("#output")
    output_div.innerText = arrr.translate(english)
```

It's not very complicated Python code.

On line 1 the `arrr` module is imported so we can do the actual English to
Pirate translation. If we hadn't told PyScript to download the `arrr` module
in our `pyscript.json` configuration file, this line would cause an error.
PyScript has ensured our environment is set up with the expected `arrr` module.

Line 2 imports the `document` object. The `document` allows us to reach into
the things on the web page defined in `index.html`.

Finally, on line 5 the `translate_english` function is defined.

The `translate_english` function takes a single parameter called
`event`. This represents the user's click of the button (but which we don't
actually use).

Inside the body of the function we first get a reference to the `input`
element with the [`document.querySelector` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)
that takes `#english` as its
parameter (indicating we want the element with the id "english"). We assign the
result to `input_text`, then extract the user's `english` from the
`input_text`'s `value`. Next, we get a reference called `output_div` that
points to the `div` element with the id "output". Finally, we assign the
`innerText` of the `output_div` to the result of calling
[`arrr.translate`](https://arrr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#arrr.translate)
(to actually translate the `english` to something piratical).

That's it!

## Sharing your app

### PyScript.com

If you're using [pyscript.com](https://pyscript.com), you should save all your files
and click the "run" button. Assuming you've copied the code properly, you
should have a fine old time using "Polyglot ü¶ú" to translate English to
Pirate-ish.

Alternatively, [click here to see a working example of this app](https://ntoll.pyscriptapps.com/piratical/v5/).
Notice that the bottom right hand corner contains a link to view the code on
[pyscript.com](https://pyscript.com). Why not explore the code, copy it to your own
account and change it to your satisfaction?

### From a web server

Just host the three files (`pyscript.json`, `index.html`
and `main.py`) in the same directory on a static web server somewhere.

Clearly, we recommend you use [pyscript.com](https://pyscript.com) for this, but any
static web host will do (for example,
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
[Amazon's S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html),
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website) or
[Microsoft's Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website)).
